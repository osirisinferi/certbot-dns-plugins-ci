# This new upstream ebuild of Certbot reworks the entire Certbot ebuild which
# now includes the `acme` library and almost all the DNS plugins, except for
# `dns-cloudflare` and `dns-digitalocean` (which require packages missing in
# the main Gentoo repository).
# We block this new version of the Certbot ebuild for now until we figure out
# some smart way to make it work again.
